## What's in it for you

There are many benefits to volunteering for the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

### Your skills and development

Volunteering as a translator helps you develop lots of different skills and gain new knowledge. The soft skills you develop are teamworking, communication, time management and attention to detail. You'll gain a thorough understanding of translation and localisation, you will improve your English language skills as well as writing skills in your native language. You will also develop solid research skills and basic knowledge of programming. 

These skills and knowledge can be useful in your day-to-day life, employment or studies. Moreover, we will direct you to **free courses** and will offer you opportunities to participate in **free training** that will help you develop even further. 

### Reference letters, endorsements, and certificates

We can provide reference letters and offer LinkedIn endorsements for the skills you develop as part of our programme. We are also offering Volunteer Certificates.
